❓what is hot restart?

Hot restart completely restart the app and rebuild the state from scratch.

When you perform a hot restart, Flutter recompiles the entire application and restarts it, reloading all the necessary assets, but it preserves the current navigation stack and application state. This means that you can make changes to your code and see them reflected in the running application almost instantly, without having to go through the entire build process again.

❓what is hot reload?

Hot reload in Flutter is a development feature that allows developers to make changes to their Flutter codebase and see those changes reflected almost instantly in the running application. 

❓What is Flutter Architecture?

◉ Flutter follows a layered architecture pattern consisting of Framework, Engine, and Embedding layers.
◉ The Framework layer provides foundational classes and widgets for UI development.
◉ The Engine layer manages UI rendering using the Skia graphics library.
◉ The Embedding layer facilitates communication between Flutter and the host platform.

❓What are Widgets in Flutter?

◉ Widgets in Flutter are UI components used to build the user interface.
◉ They can be categorized into stateless and stateful widgets.
◉ Widgets are composable and can be nested to create complex UI layouts.
◉ Flutter provides a rich library of built-in widgets, and developers can create custom widgets as needed.

❓What is widget tree?

> The widget tree is the fundamental structure in Flutter for building the user interface (UI) of your app. 
> It's a hierarchical arrangement of widgets, where each widget acts as a building block and represents a part of the UI.

❓What are  the other trees in flutter?

> Element Tree:

The element tree is a lightweight representation of the widget tree created by the Flutter framework.
Each widget in the widget tree has a corresponding element in the element tree.
The element tree tracks the state information associated with each widget instance. This allows the framework to determine which parts of the UI need to be rebuilt when the state changes.

> Render Object Tree:

The render object tree is the most bottom-level representation and directly translates the UI structure into elements the system understands for painting on the screen.
It consists of "RenderObjects" that define the layout, styling, and painting logic for each UI element.
The framework uses this tree to determine the visual layout and how to paint each element on the screen.

❓what are the types of widgets?

🔸Stateless Widgets:

◉ Stateless widgets are immutable and do not maintain any internal state.
◉ They represent UI elements that do not change over time.
◉ Examples include text labels, icons, and static images.

🔸Stateful Widgets:

◉ Stateful widgets maintain mutable state that can change over time.
◉ They are used for interactive elements or components that require dynamic updates.
◉ Examples include forms, animations, and components with user input.

❓what is state in flutter?

◉ state" refers to the data that can change over time and affect the behavior of a widget.
◉ It represents the current condition of a widget.

 > Ephemeral State:

   -> Ephemeral state refers to the local state that is confined to a specific widget or subtree of the widget tree.
   -> Ephemeral state is managed by stateful widgets using the setState() method, which triggers a rebuild of the widget subtree when the state changes.
   -> Examples of ephemeral state include form input fields, toggle switches, or the current scroll position of a list.
 
 > App State:

   -> App state refers to the global state of the entire Flutter application.
   -> It includes data or information that needs to be shared and accessed across multiple widgets or screens within the application.
   -> App state is typically managed using state management techniques such as provider, bloc, redux, or inherited widget.
   -> Examples of app state include user authentication status, theme preferences, or data fetched from an API that needs to be accessed from different parts of the application.


❓scaffold

* Scaffold is a widget that provides a basic layout structure for a material design-style application.
* It serves as the structural foundation for a typical mobile application.
* offering common layout elements such as an app bar, a floating action button (FAB), a drawer, and a body area where you can place your application's content.


❓What is builder in flutter?

* A builder in Flutter is to dynamically construct UI elements based on specific conditions or data.
* Builders provide a flexible and efficient way to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces by allowing widgets to generate their content on-demand.

❓ListView Widget:

● The ListView widget creates a scrollable list of children directly within its constructor.
● When using ListView, you provide a list of widgets as its children parameter. This means that all list items are ● ● built and stored in memory upfront, which may not be efficient for large lists or dynamically changing data.

❓ListView.builder Constructor:

● The ListView.builder constructor is used when you want to create a scrollable list with items generated dynamically based on a data source.
● It takes a builder function as a parameter, which is called lazily to build each item in the list as it becomes visible on the screen. This approach is more memory-efficient because only the items currently visible on the screen are built and stored in memory.
● ListView.builder is commonly used for efficiently displaying large lists or lists with dynamically changing content.

❓What is preffered size widget?

=> A preferred size widget is one that suggests a size to its parent widget or layout.
=> It's commonly used by widgets like AppBar or BottomNavigationBar to communicate their preferred dimensions to their parent widgets or layout managers.

❓What is ConstraintBox widget?

→ A ConstraintBox in Flutter is a widget that applies constraints to its child widget, limiting its size within specified parameters.
→ It's commonly used to enforce minimum, maximum, or exact size constraints on its child, ensuring that the child widget adheres to specific layout requirements.


❓What is Isolates in flutter?

■ In Flutter, isolates are independent workers that run concurrently with the main UI thread. 
■ They are used for executing computationally intensive tasks, performing background processing, or handling asynchronous operations without blocking the UI. 
■ Isolates have their own memory heap and run in separate threads, providing a means to parallelize work and maintain UI responsiveness in Flutter applications.

Tooltip: Widget for displaying a brief message when a user long-presses or hovers over a widget.
SliverAppBar: Widget for implementing an app bar that integrates with a CustomScrollView and provides various scrolling effects.

❓What is Scroll Controller?

> A ScrollController in Flutter is a controller used to control and manipulate scrolling behavior within scrollable widgets such as ListView, GridView, and ScrollView. 
> It allows developers to programmatically scroll to specific positions, listen to scroll events, and retrieve information about the current scroll state.

Key features and functions of a ScrollController:

Scroll Position: It provides access to the current scroll offset, allowing developers to determine the position of the scrollable content relative to its initial position.

Scroll Actions: Developers can programmatically scroll to a specific position within the scrollable widget using methods such as jumpTo, animateTo, or animateToPage.

Scroll Events: ScrollController emits notifications about scroll-related events, such as when scrolling starts, stops, or updates occur. Developers can listen to these events and perform custom actions in response.

Scroll Physics: It allows developers to customize the scrolling behavior by specifying custom scroll physics using the physics property.

Disposing: ScrollController should be disposed of when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Developers can call the dispose method to release any resources associated with the controller.



❓What is Flutter inspector?

> The Flutter Inspector is a tool used for debugging and inspecting Flutter applications during development. 
> It provides a visual representation of the widget tree, allowing developers to examine the UI hierarchy, inspect widget properties, and debug layout issues. 

❓what is the Method Channel in Flutter?

> The MethodChannel in Flutter is a way for Flutter code to talk to platform-specific code, like Java or Swift. 
> For example, if you need to access a feature that's not available in Flutter, like accessing device sensors or platform-specific APIs, you can use MethodChannel to call methods written in the platform-specific code from your Flutter app, and get the results back.

❓What is an intrinsic widget in Flutter?

> An intrinsic widget in Flutter is a type of widget that sizes itself based on its content or intrinsic properties. 
> Intrinsic widgets are particularly useful when you want the size of a widget to be determined by its content, making it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts in Flutter applications.

❓What is debouncer?

> debouncer is a utility used to delay the execution of a function until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last invocation of the function. 
> This is commonly used in scenarios where you want to delay the execution of a function, such as handling user input in search bars or filtering large datasets.

❓What is KeyStore?

> keystore is a file used to store cryptographic keys, such as encryption keys or digital certificates, securely. 
> It's commonly used in Android development for signing Android apps before deploying them to the Google Play Store.

❓Keys in Flutter?

> "key" in Flutter is like a name tag for widgets. 
> It helps Flutter keep track of individual widgets, especially when they change or move around.
> Keys uniquely identify widgets in a widget tree.
> Keys help Flutter's reconciliation algorithm determine whether a widget has changed, been added, or been removed when rebuilding the widget tree. 
> Keys can be used to preserve the state of widgets across widget tree rebuilds. 
>Keys are essential when working with widgets like AnimatedList and ListView.builder.

❓What are the steps to host the app?

🔸Prepare Your App: Ensure that your app is thoroughly tested, optimized, and ready for release. Make sure it adheres to Google Play policies and guidelines.

🔸Generate a Keystore: Create a keystore file if you haven't already done so. This keystore will be used to sign your app before uploading it to the Play Store. Keep the keystore file and its credentials secure.

🔸Build Your App for Release: Generate a release build of your app using Flutter's build command or IDE options. Make sure to use the keystore file and its credentials to sign the release build.

🔸Prepare Your App Listing: Log in to the Google Play Console, create a new app listing, and provide all the required information such as the app's title, description, screenshots, and icon. Set up pricing and distribution options as needed.

🔸Upload Your Release Build: In the Google Play Console, navigate to the "App releases" section and create a new release. Upload your release build (APK or App Bundle) along with any release notes or changes.

❓What is ndk version and skd version in flutter?

>NDK (Native Development Kit) Version: 
The NDK is a toolset provided by Google to allow Android developers to build performance-critical portions of their apps in native code (typically written in C or C++)
>SDK (Software Development Kit) Version: 
The SDK version in Flutter typically refers to the version of the Android SDK used by Flutter for development and building Android apps. 

❓What is multidex in Flutter?

> In Flutter, multidex is a technique used to overcome a limitation in older Android versions (below API level 21)  related to the number of methods an app can reference. 
> There's a limit of 64K methods in a single Dalvik Executable (DEX) file, which can be exceeded by complex apps with many dependencies or plugins.

> Enabling multidex allows the app to be packaged with multiple DEX files, effectively bypassing the 64K method limit. 
> Flutter offers automatic multidex support during the build process if it detects your app targets API level 20 or below and exceeds the method limit.

❓What is integration testing?

> Integration testing in Flutter, also known as end-to-end testing or GUI testing, is a type of software testing that checks how different components of an app work together as a whole. 
> It simulates a user interacting with the app and captures how it performs on a real device. 
> Integration testing is a crucial part of the Flutter testing process, and is essential for high-level verification of the system's composite function.
